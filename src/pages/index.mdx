## Appendix A: Overview of Indoor Navigation Technologies

- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons**: BLE beacons are small, inexpensive devices that send signals to smartphones, allowing for proximity-based location. By detecting signal strength, these systems can predict a user's location to within a few meters, making them appropriate for large-scale deployments in university settings [1].

- **Wi-Fi Positioning**: Wi-Fi positioning triangulates a user's location using signal levels from several access points. While frequently available, signal interference, common in busy campuses, can reduce its precision to 5-10 meters.

- **Ultra-Wideband (UWB)**: UWB measures radio wave travel time between devices for centimeter-accuracy location. Precision makes it ideal for complex navigation tasks, but needs specialized equipment [2].

- **Computer Vision**: Computer vision scans camera pictures to identify landmarks, signs, and barriers, delivering positional and contextual information. Blind users needing real-time environmental awareness will be helped from this.

- **Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)**: IMUs with accelerometers and gyroscopes measure motion and orientation. When used with other technologies, dead reckoning can predict location changes, enhancing navigation continuity in signal-poor areas.


## Figures

Use the figure component to display images, videos, equations, or any other element, with an optional caption.

<Figure>
  <Image slot="figure" source={transformer} altText="Diagram of the transformer deep learning architecture." />
  <span slot="caption">Diagram of the transformer deep learning architecture.</span>
</Figure>

## Image comparison slider

An interactive, accessible slider component with keyboard navigation.
<Figure>
  <ImageComparison slot="figure" client:load imageUrlOne={dogsDiffc.src} imageUrlTwo={dogsTrue.src} altTextOne="Photo of two dogs running side-by-side in shallow water, lossily compressed using the DiffC algorithm" altTextTwo="Original photo of two dogs running side-by-side in shallow water" />
  <span slot="caption">A photo of two dogs running side-by-side in shallow water, lossily compressed using the <a href="https://jeremyiv.github.io/diffc-project-page/">DiffC algorithm</a>.</span>
</Figure>

## Two columns

Use the two columns component to display two columns of content. In this example, the first column contains a figure with a YouTube video and the second column contains a figure with a custom [React](https://react.dev/) component. By default, they display side by side, but if the screen is narrow enough (for example, on mobile), they're arranged vertically.

<TwoColumns>
  <Figure slot="left">
    <YouTubeVideo slot="figure" videoId="wjZofJX0v4M" />
    <span slot="caption">Take a look at this YouTube video.</span>
  </Figure>
  <Figure slot="right">
    <Splat slot="figure" client:idle />
    <span slot="caption">Now look at this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_splatting">Gaussian splat</a>, rendered with a React component.</span>
  </Figure>
</TwoColumns>

## Heading levels

Use headings to divide your content into sections.

### Heading 3

Go down a level to heading 3...

#### Heading 4

...and down again to heading 4.

## LaTeX

You can also add LaTeX formulas, rendered during the build process using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) so they're quick to load for visitors of your project page. You can write them inline, like this: <LaTeX inline formula="a^2 + b^2 = c^2" />. Or, you can write them as a block:

<LaTeX formula="\int_a^b f(x) dx" />

## Tables

You can add simple tables using [GitHub Flavored Markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-tables):

| Model | Accuracy | F1 score | Training time (hours) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| BERT-base | 0.89 | 0.87 | 4.5 |
| RoBERTa-large | 0.92 | 0.91 | 7.2 |
| DistilBERT | 0.86 | 0.84 | 2.1 |
| XLNet | 0.90 | 0.89 | 6.8 |
